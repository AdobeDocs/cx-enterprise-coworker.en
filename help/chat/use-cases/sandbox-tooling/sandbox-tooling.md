## Supported use cases {#supported-use-cases}

Explore common ways to use Sandbox Tooling Agentic Skills to simplify sandbox management and metadata migration.

### Move object metadata across sandboxes

As a sandbox administrator managing multiple Adobe Experience Platform sandboxes, you can migrate object metadata using natural-language requests instead of manually navigating the user interface.

Using CX Coworker, you can migrate object metadata—including schemas, audiences, and related configuration assets—from one sandbox to another by describing the migration in natural language. Sandbox Tooling Agentic Skills automatically identify and package the required dependencies, helping ensure a reliable migration.

For example:

- "Move schema Luma Loyalty Members Platinum from the current sandbox to the production sandbox."

### Promote audiences between sandboxes

As a sandbox administrator, you can promote audiences between environments without manually recreating or reconfiguring them.

For example:

- "Promote the 'Audience name' audience to the staging sandbox."

Sandbox Tooling Agentic Skills identify the specified audience, validate its dependencies, and migrate all required objects to the target sandbox.

## Example prompts {#example-prompts}

Use the following prompts as examples when interacting with Sandbox Tooling Agentic Skills.

### Schema prompts

Use these prompts when you know the schema name and destination sandbox.

- "Move schema 'Schema name' from the current sandbox to the production sandbox."

### Audience prompts

Use these prompts when you know the audience name.

- "Promote the 'Audience name' audience to the staging sandbox."
